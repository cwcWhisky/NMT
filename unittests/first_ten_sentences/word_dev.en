when I was in my 20s , I saw my very first psychotherapy client .
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley .
she was a 26 - year - old woman named Alex .
now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems .
now when I heard this , I was so relieved .
my classmate got an arsonist for her first client .
and I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys .
this I thought I could handle .
but I did n't handle it .
with the funny stories that Alex would bring to session , it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road .
